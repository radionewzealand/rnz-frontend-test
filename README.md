# RNZ front-end test

Welcome! This is a technical test with a real working project. It uses a number of front-end tools and technologies and it tests working knowledge of these tools.
This test is intended to be submitted in the form of a ZIP or a linked repository or similar.

## Instructions

Carefully read the following, think about what is being tested for, and complete the steps for each section. Some sections can be completed and findings documented, while others will be in the form of code changes to this project. If you find that you can't complete a particular section, feel free to share your thinking, anything you tried that did not work, and any resources you used. Take as long as you need, but we would hope not to spend more than an hour or two of your time on this exercise.

## Final submission

Please zip your finished project repository into a single file excluding the `node_modules` directory (`.cache`, `.git` and `dist` are fine to include), and submit it to your primary contact person.

### üíÖ 4. HTML & CSS

We have two designs for an image grid and modal image gallery prototype. Load `/design-mock-1.html` and load `/design-mock-2.html` in a browser to see the prototype. Users will be able to click the "View" buttons at the bottom of each image in the grid to view a larger image in a modal-gallery.

#### Please:
